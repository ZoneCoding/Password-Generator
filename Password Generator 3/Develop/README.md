##Project Description

Modifying starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. Using javascript to create these selected features.

##What problem does it solve?

It would help users to be able to generate passwords that are wanted to be applied to varius applications

##Some of the challenges...

A lot of the problems I faced was finding what functions to use and var to create, represent and redirecting them to the correct areas that will produce the end game of generating random passwords.

##What did I learn?
I learned that checking over and over and over, console.logging everything and learning new functions such as 

    var lowercaseList = ['a','b','c','d','e','f','g','h','i','j','k','l','m','n','o','p','q','r','s','t','u','v','w','x','y','z']

    var uppercaseList = []

    for (var i = 0; i < lowercaseList.length; i++) {
      uppercaseList[i] = lowercaseList[i].toUpperCase()

these 'for' loop that was able to copy a variable that i had and create and action or change of it such as making it all uppercase. Combining things I learned in class and from surfing the web.

Big show out to TA Nathan for checking up on me, I definitely was struggling and was so demotivated but I was able to muster the passion to continue on.
